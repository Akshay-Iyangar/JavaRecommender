Step 1:
Have performed crawling in scraping for wiki and Oracle.
You can find the code for crawling and scraping in method crawler

The file after crawling in corpus which has all the crawled data.

Step 2:

The indexdir directory consist of all the index files.
Note: If you want to run this method please uncomment the methods in Queryoutput and just run them to see the crawling and indexing. Also before the query put the indexdir folder inside /src/main/resources<<IMPT>> Please donâ€™t skip this step.

<<DO THIS ONLY IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW THE CRAWLING AND INDEXING WORKS>>

Step3:
QueryProcess
This is the step where on input of string or fixed post you get an output.
The method used to do this is queryprocessor.
Class:Queryoutput
method:queryprocessor

The servlet file name is ServletController which calls the ExcelReader to read the post from .xlsx and give it to the query processor.

There are instructions present on code if you face issues.
