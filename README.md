### Step 1

_Have performed crawling in scraping for wiki and Oracle_.

You can find the code for crawling and scraping in method `crawler` (class: `Queryoutput`)

The file after crawling in corpus which has all the crawled data.

### Step 2

_Performed Indexing_.

You can find the code for indexing inside the method `indexer` (class `Queryoutput`) using standard analyzer and _Porter Stemmer_ for stemming the query.

The `indexdir` directory consist of all the index files.

Note: If you want to run this method please uncomment the methods in `Queryoutput` and just run them to see the crawling and indexing. Also before the query, put the indexdir folder inside `/src/main/resources<<IMPT>>`. Please donâ€™t skip this step!

**DO THIS ONLY IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW THE CRAWLING AND INDEXING WORKS**

## Step 3

_QueryProcess_

This is the step where on input of string or fixed post you get an output. The method used to do this is `queryprocessor` (class `Queryoutput`).

The servlet file name is `ServletController`, which calls the `ExcelReader` to read the post from `.xlsx` and give it to the query processor.

There are instructions present on code if you face issues.

If for some reason the code throws an error, please check that the maven dependencies are present in by right clicking on properties. 

Deployment Assembly. the source should have Maven dependencies present. If not, go to `Add > Java Library > Maven Dependencies` and `Apply` and `OK` it. Also please create a Maven project with webapp-archetype.
