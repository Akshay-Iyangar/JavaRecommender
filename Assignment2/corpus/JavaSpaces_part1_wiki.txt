<p>JavaSpaces technology is part of the Java <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jini" class="extiw" title="w:Jini">Jini</a> technology. The basic features of JINI are:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><b>No user intervention</b> is needed when services are brought on or offline. (In contrast to EJBs where the client program has to know the server and port number where the EJB is deployed. In JINI the client is <i>supposed to find</i>, discover the service in the network.)</li> 
 <li><b>Self healing</b> by adapting when services (consumers of services) come and go. Services need to periodically renew a lease to indicate that they are still available.</li> 
 <li>Consumers of JINI services do not need prior knowledge of the service's implementation. The <b>implementation is downloaded dynamically</b> and run on the consumer JVM, without configuration and user intervention. For example, the end user may be presented with slightly different user interface depending which service is being used at the time. The implementation of those user interface code would be provided by the service being used.</li> 
</ul>

   This fact that the implementation is running on the consumer/client's JVM can increase performance, by eliminating the need of remote calls.

<p>A minimal JINI network environment consists of:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>One or more <b>services</b></li> 
 <li>A <b>lookup-service</b> keeping a list of registered services</li> 
 <li>One or more <b>consumers</b></li> 
</ul>
