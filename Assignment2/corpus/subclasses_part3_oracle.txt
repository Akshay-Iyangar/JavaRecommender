<p>Here is the sample code for a possible implementation of a <code>Bicycle</code> class that was presented in the Classes and Objects lesson: </p> 
<div class="codeblock"> 
 <pre>
public class Bicycle {
        
    // <b>the Bicycle class has three <i>fields</i></b>
    public int cadence;
    public int gear;
    public int speed;
        
    // <b>the Bicycle class has one <i>constructor</i></b>
    public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {
        gear = startGear;
        cadence = startCadence;
        speed = startSpeed;
    }
        
    // <b>the Bicycle class has four <i>methods</i></b>
    public void setCadence(int newValue) {
        cadence = newValue;
    }
        
    public void setGear(int newValue) {
        gear = newValue;
    }
        
    public void applyBrake(int decrement) {
        speed -= decrement;
    }
        
    public void speedUp(int increment) {
        speed += increment;
    }
        
}
</pre> 
</div> 
<p>A class declaration for a <code>MountainBike</code> class that is a subclass of <code>Bicycle</code> might look like this:</p> 
<div class="codeblock"> 
 <pre>
public class MountainBike extends Bicycle {
        
    // <b>the MountainBike subclass adds one <i>field</i></b>
    public int seatHeight;

    // <b>the MountainBike subclass has one <i>constructor</i></b>
    public MountainBike(int startHeight,
                        int startCadence,
                        int startSpeed,
                        int startGear) {
        super(startCadence, startSpeed, startGear);
        seatHeight = startHeight;
    }   
        
    // <b>the MountainBike subclass adds one <i>method</i></b>
    public void setHeight(int newValue) {
        seatHeight = newValue;
    }   
}
</pre> 
</div> 
<p><code>MountainBike</code> inherits all the fields and methods of <code>Bicycle</code> and adds the field <code>seatHeight</code> and a method to set it. Except for the constructor, it is as if you had written a new <code>MountainBike</code> class entirely from scratch, with four fields and five methods. However, you didn't have to do all the work. This would be especially valuable if the methods in the <code>Bicycle</code> class were complex and had taken substantial time to debug.</p>
