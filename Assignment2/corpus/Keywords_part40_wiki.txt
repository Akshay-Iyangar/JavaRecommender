<p><code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Keywords/native" title="Java Programming/Keywords/native"><font style="color:DodgerBlue4; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">native</font></a></code> is a java keyword. It marks a method, that it will be implemented in other languages, not in Java. The method is declared without a body and cannot be <code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Keywords/abstract" title="Java Programming/Keywords/abstract"><font style="color:DodgerBlue4; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">abstract</font></a></code>. It works together with <a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Java_Native_Interface" title="Java Programming/Java Native Interface">JNI (Java Native Interface)</a>.</p> 
<p>Syntax:</p> 
<pre>
[<code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Keywords/public" title="Java Programming/Keywords/public"><font style="color:DodgerBlue4; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">public</font></a></code>|<code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Keywords/protected" title="Java Programming/Keywords/protected"><font style="color:DodgerBlue4; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">protected</font></a></code>|<code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Keywords/private" title="Java Programming/Keywords/private"><font style="color:DodgerBlue4; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">private</font></a></code>] <code><a href="/wiki/Java_Programming/Keywords/native" title="Java Programming/Keywords/native"><font style="color:DodgerBlue4; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">native</font></a></code> method();

<p>Native methods were used in the past to write performance critical sections but with java getting faster this is now less common. Native methods are currently needed when</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>You need to call from java a library, written in another language.</li> 
 <li>You need to access system or hardware resources that are only reachable from the other language (typically <a href="/wiki/C_Programming" title="C Programming">C</a>). Actually, many system functions that interact with real computer (disk and network IO, for instance) can only do this because they call native code.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>To complete writing native method, you need to process your class with <code>javah</code> tool that will generate a header code in C. You then need to provide implementation of the header code, produce dynamically loadable library (<code>.so</code> under Linux, <code>.dll</code> under Windows) and load it (in the simplest case with <code>System.load(library_file_name)</code> . The code completion is trivial if only primitive types like integers are passed but gets more complex if it is needed to exchange strings or objects from the C code. In general, everything can be on C level, including creation of the new objects and calling back methods, written in java.</p> 
<p>To call the code in some other language (including <a href="/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming" title="C++ Programming">C++</a>), you need to write a bridge from C to that language. This is usually trivial as most of languages are callable from C.</p>
