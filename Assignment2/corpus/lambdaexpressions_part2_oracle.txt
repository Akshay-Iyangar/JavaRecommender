<p>Suppose that you are creating a social networking application. You want to create a feature that enables an administrator to perform any kind of action, such as sending a message, on members of the social networking application that satisfy certain criteria. The following table describes this use case in detail:</p> 
<table border="1" summary="Use case for social networking application"> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <th id="h1">Field</th> 
   <th id="h2">Description</th> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td headers="h1">Name</td> 
   <td headers="h2">Perform action on selected members</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td headers="h1">Primary Actor</td> 
   <td headers="h2">Administrator</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td headers="h1">Preconditions</td> 
   <td headers="h2">Administrator is logged in to the system.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td headers="h1">Postconditions</td> 
   <td headers="h2">Action is performed only on members that fit the specified criteria.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td headers="h1">Main Success Scenario</td> 
   <td headers="h2"> 
    <ol> 
     <li>Administrator specifies criteria of members on which to perform a certain action.</li> 
     <li>Administrator specifies an action to perform on those selected members.</li> 
     <li>Administrator selects the <strong>Submit</strong> button.</li> 
     <li>The system finds all members that match the specified criteria.</li> 
     <li>The system performs the specified action on all matching members.</li> 
    </ol> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td headers="h1">Extensions</td> 
   <td headers="h2"> <p>1a. Administrator has an option to preview those members who match the specified criteria before he or she specifies the action to be performed or before selecting the <strong>Submit</strong> button.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td headers="h1">Frequency of Occurrence</td> 
   <td headers="h2">Many times during the day.</td> 
  </tr>

<p>Suppose that members of this social networking application are represented by the following <a class="SourceLink" target="_blank" href="examples/Person.java" onclick="showCode('https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/displayCode.html', 'examples/Person.java'); return false;"><code>Person</code></a> class:</p> 
<pre class="codeblock">public class Person {

    public enum Sex {
        MALE, FEMALE
    }

    String name;
    LocalDate birthday;
    Sex gender;
    String emailAddress;

    public int getAge() {
        // ...
    }

    public void printPerson() {
        // ...
    }
}</pre> 
<p>Suppose that the members of your social networking application are stored in a <code>List&lt;Person&gt;</code> instance.</p> 
<p>This section begins with a naive approach to this use case. It improves upon this approach with local and anonymous classes, and then finishes with an efficient and concise approach using lambda expressions.
