<p>Package names are written in all lower case to avoid conflict with the names of classes or interfaces.</p> 
<p>Companies use their reversed Internet domain name to begin their package namesÂ—for example, <code>com.example.mypackage</code> for a package named <code>mypackage</code> created by a programmer at <code>example.com</code>.</p> 
<p>Name collisions that occur within a single company need to be handled by convention within that company, perhaps by including the region or the project name after the company name (for example, <code>com.example.region.mypackage</code>).</p> 
<p>Packages in the Java language itself begin with <code>java.</code> or <code>javax.</code></p> 
<p>In some cases, the internet domain name may not be a valid package name. This can occur if the domain name contains a hyphen or other special character, if the package name begins with a digit or other character that is illegal to use as the beginning of a Java name, or if the package name contains a reserved Java keyword, such as "int". In this event, the suggested convention is to add an underscore. For example:</p>
